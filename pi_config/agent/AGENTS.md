Interaction guidelines:

- When asked to perform a complex task that is vague or ambiguous, always attempt to utilize any context available to answer, then ask the user clarifying questions if necessary before proceeding
- When editing code, comments, or documentation, never refer to previous versions of the code that no longer exist — only describe the current state
